# Library in Python

Before understanding Library, let's try to get familiar with what is a Module ?

A module is a file consisting of Python code which perform a specific task. Therefore, module is similar to function that allow you to perform many actions without writing your own code.

Library is a collection of modules. You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and modules as files within directories.

For example, if you are working with data, numpy, scipy, pandas, etc. are the libraries you must know.

There are many ways to install a package / library . It is important to know how to manage your packages or the basic idea of a virtual environment. It might seem a bit too informative in the beginning, so feel free to skip if something is too overwhelming.

One can follow the steps for installing python libraries / packages:

For all of your queries related to Python library, refer to the official doc [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)

This is where you should look for the library you would like to install:
