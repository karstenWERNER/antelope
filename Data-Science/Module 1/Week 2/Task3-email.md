Hello Team,

**BlueBerry Winery**, a *start-up wine maker* in Portugal, have approached **CODE Analytics** to help them build a **Wine Quality Analytics system** which can help them determine the quality of wines produced based on ingredients & composition.

Like any modern start-up company, **BlueBerry Winery** is trying to enter the business with a good amount of analytics & research on domain knowledge. 20% of Wine companies fail because they do not start with preliminary quality research on either market / wine quality. With the advancement of technology, more and more companies trust data and machine learning to come to a decision instead of expert recommendation / analysis.


From a Sales & Marketing perspective, it is of utmost priority to put a proper price tag for a bottle of wine so that there is no mismatch between quality and price of the product which is one of the major factors contributing to 'Customer Satisfaction'.


It is not only the composition but also many other factors that contribute to the quality. The age of a bottle of wine plays a significant role as time changes the taste of the fruit flavors in a wine as well as reduces the acidity and tannin in a wine. As the acidity and tannin are reduced, the wine becomes rounder and smoother. The analysis should not restrict to the technical specifications but include the business / domain aspects so that it can help **BlueBerry Winery** with Business Decisions.


Thanks & Regards,\
Mark Davis Jr.\
