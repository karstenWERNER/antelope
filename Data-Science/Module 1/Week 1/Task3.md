Finally, it is Friday!



![friday](../images/37_Coffee.jpg)

Today, you would be required to book your mentor individually and have feedback on all of your assignments. At the same time, you can try to document the things which you consider important for your **Learning report** which you have to submit at the end of the module.

Some studies show that human beings have a retention capacity of less than 20% of what they learn at a particular point. So, please do not neglect the fact of documentation right from the beginning.

Please feel free to be innovative in choosing the documentation layout/ platform. Some of you might find it interesting to document it in GITHUB itself as a README file.

However, A document should include the title at least. Rests you decide.
