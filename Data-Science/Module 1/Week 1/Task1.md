# Python and the Tools

## What Is Python?

Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. It was developed by Guido van Rossum. Most of the major online platforms, for example, Google, Dropbox, Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify — all run on Python.

In the beginning, you don’t need to know all of the mentioned characteristics : object-oriented, interpreted, high-level programming. Slowly, we would discuss it as we progress.

A brief history of how Python was created can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python).

**Readable**: Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax.

**Easy to Learn**: Learning python is easy as this is an expressive and high-level programming language, which means it is easy to understand the language and thus easy to learn. Nowadays, most universities choose to teach students Python as it is best suited for beginners to learn.

**Cross-platform**: Python is available and can run on various operating systems such as Mac, Windows, Linux, Unix etc. This makes it a cross-platform and portable language.

**Open Source**: Python is an open-source programming language.

**Large standard library**: Python comes with a large standard library that has some handy codes and functions which we can use while writing code in Python.

**Free**: Python is free to download and use. This means you can download it for free and use it in your application. See: Open Source Python License. Python is an example of a FLOSS (Free-Libre / Open Source Software), which means you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code and modify it.

**Supports exception handling**: If you are new, you may wonder what is an exception? An exception is an event that can occur during a program exception and can disrupt the normal flow of the program. Python supports exception handling which means we can write less error-prone code and can test various scenarios that can cause an exception later on.

**Advanced features**: Supports generators and list comprehensions. We will cover these features later.
Automatic memory management: Python supports automatic memory management which means the memory is cleared and freed automatically. You do not have to bother clearing the memory.

More details on that can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-features/)

## What can Python do?

- Python is used for desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems and modify the contents of the database.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

## How does Python work?

![How python works](https://dsft.code-data-ai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/m1-1-2.png)

The key here is the Interpreter that is responsible for translating high-level Python language to low-level machine language.

An interpreter is a kind of program that executes other programs.
When you write a Python program,the Python interpreter reads your program and carries out the instructions it contains Basically, the interpreter is a layer of software logic between your code and the computer hardware on your machine.

However, before the Python code is interpreted, the code is compiled into **Bytecode** so that it can be run on any platform.

That is why Python can be called **both** Compiled and Interpreted language.

Please check here to know more about Interpreted and Compiled language.

## Install Python

The recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we will use throughout our course.

Python can be written in a simple text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment (IDEs), such as Pycharm, Spyder, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing large collections of Python files.

However, in the beginning, You will start writing Python code in **Jupyter Notebook** (Anaconda platform) or **Google Colab** cloud environment. Alongside, You can use **Visual Studio Code** as it offers advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality.

To install Anaconda for Windows, please follow these [steps](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

To install Anaconda for macOS, please follow these [steps](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/).

Post Installation please [verify](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/) whether the Installation was successful or not:

Post this, the last task is to install the Visual Studio Code (IDE). You can follow the guidelines here.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

Alright! Today you would be required to finish all the setup, so that you can start Coding Python in Task 2.

If you are stuck, you know what to do!

## Introduction to Trello

Trello is a Project and task management tool. Trello, at its core, is used to organize “cards” into lists—those cards can be tasks, notes, projects, shared files, or anything else that helps your team work together.

Trello often helps people to work on same project  in a collaborative manner where you organize your projects onto boards with lists and cards (tasks) and other team members can check at which phase is the project/ tasks.

Trello makes it easy to see at a glance who is working on something, which things are in progress, which ones are complete and what different people have been doing.

## Trello as a Priority tool

The best way to designate priority (possibly the only way) is to use labels. Labels in Trello have different colors, so you can get a quick overview of different tasks with a quick glance at the board.

You could label, for instance:

**Red** for high priority tasks
**Yellow** for medium importance
**Green** for low importance

**What is Kanban ?**

The Kanban Method has been used to improve productivity and optimize processes – with great success since the 1940s. No longer confined to the factory floor where it was first implemented, people now apply Kanban to studying, retail management, and software development.

While kanban was introduced by Taiichi Ohno in the manufacturing industry, it is David J. Anderson who was the first to apply the concept to IT, Software development and knowledge work in general in the year 2004.

Using a Kanban board to visualize your workflow is a key component. Trello is a free, simple, and easy to use project management tool ideal for getting started with Kanban.

## Kanban Principles  

The Kanban Method follows a set of principles and practices for managing and improving the flow of work. It is an evolutionary, non-disruptive method that promotes gradual improvements to an organization’s processes. Businesses use Kanban to increase the efficiency of business process – improve flow, reduce cycle time, increase value to the customer, improvement in predictability, handling unprecedented situation – all of which are crucial to any business today.

**You would start using Trello from Project 1 (Week 2).**
