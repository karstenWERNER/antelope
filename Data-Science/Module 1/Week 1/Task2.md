# Python in Action  

## Data Types and Operators

Congratulations on setting up the necessary tools. Now, you would start with learning the core concepts of Python. This week, you will follow the book **Total Beginner Guide: Python** (Chapter 1 to 6) in the *Resources section*.

At the core of Python lies the concept of Data types & Operators.This is important because the specific data type you use will determine what values you can assign to it. In simple words, if you assign 5 to variable x (variable is something that varies), x is of data type numeric as it contains number. Similarly if variable x conatins 'A', it's data type is character as it contains a letter / character.

Lets dig into further:

## Variables and Data Types

Variables are reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.

Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.

Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

Python is dynamically typed, this means that you donâ€™t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like x=111 and then x="I'm a string" without error.

Python is a case sensitive langauge.

## Understanding operators

Python language supports the following types of operators.

* Arithmetic Operators
* Comparison (Relational) Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Logical Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* Membership Operators
* Identity Operators

## Decision Making

Decision making is the anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.

Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as an outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if the outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.

Python programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as TRUE, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as FALSE value.

Python programming language provides the following types of decision-making statements. Click the following links to check their detail.

## Conditional Statements and Loop

A good introduction to conditional statements and loops are [here](https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch04.html)

## Function

A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, specific task. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusability.

You already aware of many Python built-in functions like print(),len(), sum() etc. At the same time you can also create your own functions. These functions are called **user-defined functions**.

## Assignments

Some of the questions have possible solutions, however, you are not supposed to have a look at it until and unless you have tried to solve the problems by yourself.

You are supposed to finish the **Beginner Workshop (first 5 questions)**

*For advanced students, you can try to solve the next questions (Intermediate level).*
