Hello Team,

I got to know from your mentor that you have put good amount of efforts on Data Exploration already and it is very fundamental for a Junior Analyst to spend as much as time initially on Exploratory analysis.

However, from time to time, it is a common practice to communicate to the client about your progress and ***earn client trust***. 
For the same, I would like you to create a a small report which will contain  visualizations of the data which you already did and make a small presentation on your findings (***preferably between 4 - 8 slides***).\
You can have one slide discussing what will be your next steps.

The purpose of the presentation is to give our client **BlueBerry Winery** a confidence in how we'll get the work done.\
I'd also like you to provide the client with ***three key insights*** based on your analysis so far.

Please package your recommendations as a PowerPoint presentation, remembering that it is for a business, not a technical, audience. I'm looking forward to seeing your work **tomorrow**.

Thanks & Regards,\
Mark Davis Jr.\
Head, **Analytics & Research**
