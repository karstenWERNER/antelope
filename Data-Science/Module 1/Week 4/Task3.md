You are already familiar with Logistic Regression and now you can try other classification algorithms. However, before moving to try out other algorithms, you would learn about **feature importance and its necessity**.

Before you understand the concept ‘feature importance’, ***why is it even important to understand how a model works by analysing its features, especially if it performs well on the test set?(you got 99% accuracy)***  

In the real world excellent performance on a test set is just a nice start, but does not mean anything until and unless it performs similarly on the huge data from the real world. That is why,a skeptical business manager, safety officer, or privacy compliance officer, might rightfully demand some insight into why our model is so successful. Even when the model is not successful, you might feel the ned to know which features are totally unnecessary and add nothing to the performance of the model.

As data analysts you will often try to optimize model performance. Sometimes it is just as important to understand how the features in your model contribute to prediction. Unfortunately, the better performing models are also often the more complex ones with lesser visibility. Several methods exist to get some insight in these black box models. One of these is to understand feature importance methods and try to understand how 

## Feature Importance

Now that you have a working wine type classification system, you can try to interpret one of these predictive models. One of the key aspects in model interpretation is to try to understand the importance of each feature from the dataset.

You will be using the sklearn library that you already used in the previous week for the model interpretation needs.

[This article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/calculate-feature-importance-with-python/) shows how you can check feature importance for various algorithms.

## Classification Algorithms

Check what are the other classification algorithms you can use.

### Hint

**K-Nearest Neighbours**

**Decision Tree**

**Random Forest**

**Support Vector Machine**

You can choose any 2 out of these and try to do the same steps you did with ***Logistic Regression***.

As you have already been familiar with how to read Scikit Learn documentation, you might start reading the documentation and apply the algorithms with proper parameters by yourself.

Make a note of the best Performing model. Also, learn about how you can compare multiple models and plot the model performance.
