The idea of making intelligent, sentient, and self-aware machines is not something that suddenly came into existence in the last few years. In fact a lot of lore from Greek mythology talks about intelligent machines and inventions having self-awareness and intelligence of their own.

In fact, once computers started evolving with the invention of the Analytical Engine by Babbage and the first computer program, which was written by Ada Lovelace in 1842, people started wondering and contemplating that could there be a time when computers or machines truly become intelligent and start thinking for themselves. In fact, the renowned computer scientist, Alan Turing, was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, algorithms, and formal language and addressed concepts like artificial intelligence and Machine Learning as early as the 1950s. This brief insight into the evolution of making machines learn is just to give you an idea of something that has been out there since centuries but has recently started gaining a lot of attention and focus.

With faster computers, better processing, better computation power, and more storage, we have been living in what can be called, the “age of information” or the “age of data”.

Just to talk about some statistical inference about ML:

* At the beginning of 2020, the digital universe was estimated to consist of 44 zettabytes of data.

* By 2025, approximately 463 exabytes would be created every 24 hours worldwide.

* 80% of digital content is unavailable in nine out of every ten languages.

* In 2019, Google processed 3.7 million queries, Facebook saw one million logins, and YouTube recorded 4.5 million videos viewed every 60 seconds.

* Netflix’s content volume in 2019 outnumbered that of the US TV industry in 2005.

* By 2025, there would be 75 billion Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in the world.

* By 2030, nine in every ten people aged six and above would be digitally active.

Before deep dive into the theoretical subjects, You can choose to read a few articles about the need of Machine Learning in General and how companies are achieving their goals by applying machine learning techniques.

There are a lot of articles on this.

## Machine Learning Methods

Machine Learning has multiple algorithms, techniques, and methodologies that can be used to build models to solve real-world problems using data.

The following are some of the 2 broad areas of Machine Learning methods.

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning

## Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms aren’t difficult to grasp if you understand the basic concepts.Before starting to understand a specific algorithm, it is a good idea to have [a basic overview of a broad list of algorithms](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/common-machine-learning-algorithms/)

The implementation part can be skipped at the moment.

**Here are a few tips that every beginner should know:**

- Set concrete goals or deadlines.

Machine learning is getting huge and huge every year. It can be easy to go down rabbit holes. Set concrete goals for yourself and keep moving.

- Walk before you run.

You might be tempted to jump into some of the newest, cutting edge sub-fields in machine learning such as deep learning or NLP. Try to stay focused on the core concepts at the start. These advanced topics will be much easier to understand once you've mastered the core skills.

- Alternate between practice and theory.

Practice and theory go hand-in-hand. You won't be able to master theory without applying it, yet you won't know what to do without the theory.

- Write a few algorithms from scratch.

Once you've had some practice applying algorithms from existing packages, you'll want to write a few from scratch. This is not easy and if you feel difficulty, take the help of your mentor. 

This will take your understanding to the next level and allow you to customize them in the future.

- Seek different perspectives.

The way a statistician explains an algorithm will be different from the way a computer scientist explains it. Seek different explanations of the same topic.

- Tie each algorithm to value.

For each tool or algorithm you learn, try to think of ways it could be applied in business or technology. This is essential for learning how to "think" like a data scientist.

- Don't believe the hype.

Machine learning is not what the movies portray as artificial intelligence. It's a powerful tool, but you should approach problems with rationality and an open mind. ML should just be one tool in your arsenal!

- Ignore the show-offs.

Sometimes you'll see people online debating with lots of math and jargon. If you don't understand it, don't be discouraged. What matters is: Can you use ML to add value in some way? And the answer is yes, you absolutely can.

- Think "inputs/outputs" and ask "why."

At times, you might find yourself lost in the weeds. When in doubt, take a step back and think about how data inputs and outputs piece together. Ask "why" at each part of the process.

- Focus on projects!

Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will your machine learning skills be. It is advised to take your time, and try to stick to the projects and of course, do not forget to have fun along the way.

You are also encouraged to discuss with your colleague(s)/ Mentor(s) about what you learnt so far.
