Team,

David Herald, CEO of **BlueBerry Winery**, wrote this morning to me that he is quite impressed with the efforts you're putting in analysing the dataset. However, as we have almost approached the deadline for the project delivery, David would like to see the results of our efforts and would like to understand them better. Also, there is a chance of another round of funding as he is considering funding an expansion of our data mining efforts.

Therefore, tomorrow would be a big day for each of you as a representative of team 'Analytics and Research', **CODE Analytics** to impress our client. So, you need to prepare a business presentation of 8 - 12 slides keeping in mind the goals of our client. The presentation should explain the concepts and insights you have gathered so far, the methods you have used to come to a decision and finally, the results you delivered.

In addition, I would like to get David thinking about how we can leverage data mining in the future to make data-driven decisions about all aspects of our business. Would you please conduct some research that lists the types of questions machine learning can help to answer; one to two slides should be sufficient.

Remember, David doesnâ€™t have much machine learning knowledge beyond a few articles he has read. Please make sure that the presentation is not technical / theoretical and adds business value for the start-up.

In addition to the presentation for the CEO, I'd also like you to create a 2-4 page **technical report** detailing key take-aways and lessons you have learned about data analytics, making specific recommendations for how start-ups like **BlueBerry Winery** should approach such projects in the future. This report will just be seen internally by me or your mentor, so you can make it as technical as you feel it needs to be.

Thanks & Regards,\
Mark Davis Jr.\
Head, **Analytics & Research**
