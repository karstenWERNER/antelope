Team,

I am excited to share with you what Richard said today morning:

Hi Mark and your team,

You did a terrfic job in helping Capital Bikeshare have a data driven approach towards their business and I want to thank each one of your team members for their hard work and committment for such a mission critical project.

The nice part was definitely to have an App which we could use for a dashboard in future with enhanced functionalities. At the same time, you helped us with a cloud approach which saved us a lot of money by being not forced to invest into physical Servers. Also, I saw that we got some discounts from cloud providers which were just awesome. 

Our sales team were happy to work with your motivated and active team members. The interesting part for me was to notice how much your team cared about the end solution and put extra efforts to provide not only what we asked but also some value added services. This definitely shows us how **Analytics & Research** team of **CODE Analytics** do job differently.


I think, we would definitely consider your brilliant analytics team for any challenging projects in near future.

All the best,
Richard

I think we can hardly get any better feedback than this from a client like Capital Bikeshare. So, **Congratulations team** for making ourselves proud again.

This time, we would work with a E-commerce start up ***VS Electronics*** who are about to start their business in some parts of EU. This project is a bit different from others as ***VS Electronics*** could not provide us with any e-com sales/products data. 

As a **'Product Analyst'** , you have to understand the business model & domain very well. Besides looking for appropriate data sources, you will be responsble for analytics, database design and overall management & timely delivery of the project. They have hired some business consultants (E-commerce domain) already who would require your help time to time. 



Thanks & Regards,\
Mark Davis Jr.\
Head, **Analytics & Research**
