Team,

I believe, you are having good time dealing with your own datasets which might be quite challenging at sometimes (specially the raw, unprocessed data are quite tough to give a nice shape.)

Alan is happy about the fact that you built a centralised database management system which can be referred for most of the queries in general. 

He wants to know a brief statistics / overview about the data you have collected:


* Top 3 selling products in each product segment by customer rating.  

* Are they the most reviewed products as well ? 

* How do you choose to take a decision while buying a product ? Only ratings or you consider also how many people has reviewed ?

So, based on both of these, can you suggest me top 3 products in each product segment. (hint: check partition function)

* What are the average ratings for each product type. Can you think of any reasons why some product types have better rating than others ? (if any)

Can you try to do the same for median ratings ? ( This is a bit challenging )

It would be nice to check it visually ( I really like bar plots, however, the team can choose). 

I was telling the same when I saw some pie charts with so many levels which looked pretty confusing to me. This is one of my favourite pie charts though:

* What are the top 3 highest rated brands in each product segments. 

* As per Amazon, An “Amazon Verified Purchase” review indicates that the author of the review bought the product on Amazon. It also means that they purchased the product at full price without a discount. Unverified reviews mean that the reviewers did not purchase the product on the Amazon marketplace.'

I am aware of the fact that unverfied reviews can be sometimes misleading. Do you find anything as such which might raise doubts about un-verfied reviews. Then I would like to consider only verified reviews or what do you say ?

* Are there any products in top selling product list (top 10 rated product in each segment) that have been discontinued. Would be nice if you can tell the possible reasons along with.

* Sometimes, the customer reviews contain the Pros and Cons of a product. What are those for top 3 most rated products in each segments. Alan wants a report which creates 24 rows (3 for each product type) of Pros and Cons.

* Alan is also interested to know about the items which are bought together. How about doing it product category wise. For example, how more / less frequent is 'the sales of headphones and laptops' as compared to 'the sales of laptops and DLSRs'.

Would be nice to have a comparative analysis to design sales COMBO offer.

* What are the main product features that play a significant roles in Customer statisfaction. Analyse it product category wise.

Customer satisfaction can be considered equivalent to Customer rating.

* Are there any good products which are getting bad customer reviews / ratings lately. Would be a nice idea to exclude them from the inventory.

* Can you come up with at least one more findings of your own.


I think, that is all for now. Alan needs an answer by Wednesday next week.
