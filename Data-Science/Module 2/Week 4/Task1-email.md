Hi Mark,

Hope you're doing well and I feel it would be a great journey to work with you and your fantastic team. 

I was doing some premilinary analysis on businss strategeies and apparently, many e-commerce start ups fail because of lack of adequate market researches they have conducted.

In order to grow and keep moving forward with the the initial plan, we are very eager to deploy a strong market research on the products sold on Amazon, as of now. As per our last conversations, we tried to get some data; but it is not that easy to get information from amazon as they do not have any open datasets for obvious reasons; also, it requires a quite a good amount of money to buy the data from any 3rd party players. At the same time, getting the Amazon data is not our ultimate goal; we have to define a pipeline which can help us achive these kind of operations on any website we would like to get data from. 

That is why we are trying to set up a department called 'Product Analytics- Marketing' which can take this initiave forward.

That's all I wanted to say. Next time, I would like to meet your team and please let me know if you/ your team have any further questions for me. 


Best,
Alan
