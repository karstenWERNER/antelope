Hi Team,

Hope you've already explored the project a bit. As I told you earlier, you would be responsible to dedicate sometime of your work hours assisting the sales team.

The sales team approached me and wanted to know about few trends and visual stuffs. I am passing these to you:

Dear Mark,

Hope you are doing well.

I need a quick favour from your team. Our team needs below things:

-  Last week sales report shows lots of registered bike riders complained about non-availability of bikes. I am worried about the fact that 80% of them are found to be working professionals / salaried employees and they are certainly our valued customers.

Is there any steps we could take to deal with this problem. 


- Also, I do not want to get such complaints from Casual Users. Hence, how could analytics team help me in preventing this happening to Casual Users.

- Since past, I have seen in Rainy days, we do not make much profits for obvious reasons. Can you provide us a statistics about contribution of weather in bike demands.

- I believe, pollution and traffic would have some effect on sales. Can we have any investigation into that.


That's all for today. Would be nice to have these resolved by this weekend. 

Thanks again to the Analytics team who is putting such a nice efforts.
Next Monday, I would like to meet the team. Would let know if any changes in schedule.

Best,
Richard

I don't have much idea about the stuffs Richard is asking, however, I would request you to meet the deadline as it is one of the most important part of client satisfaction. Also, before you reply to Richard, please do not forget to consult your mentor for any improvement in analysis.

Thanks again!
