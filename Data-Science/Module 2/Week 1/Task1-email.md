Hello Team,

Congratulations for doing a great job in helping ***Blueberry Winery*** launch their business and making wine-lovers happy.:slightly_smiling_face:

I am excited to announce that ***Capital Bikeshare***, a mid-size bike rental company, has chosen ***CODE Analytics*** to help with 'Analytics' in designing a data-driven platform.**

As a starting point, they have provided us data set that contains hourly and daily count of rental bikes along with the weather information for a period of 24 months. Our job over the next few weeks will be to analyze this data to determine what kind of analytics and visualizations can be created that would empower their business.

As a **'Data Analyst'**, You will not only look for insights but also ***communicate to the Sales Team*** time to time and try to resolve their queries. Thereafter, you have to focus on ***forecasting bike rental demand*** for this bike sharing program. 

Have a nice start of the weeek!


Thanks & Regards,\
Mark Davis Jr.\
Head, **Analytics & Research**
