With environmental issues and health becoming trending topics, usage of bicycles as a mode of transportation has gained popularity in recent years. To encourage bike usage, cities across the world have
successfully implemented bike sharing programs. Under such schemes, riders can rent bicycles using manual/automated kiosks spread across the city for defined periods. In most cases, riders can pick up bikes from one location and return them to any other designated place.

Bike riders reduce traffic congestion as they form a valid substitution for cars on short/medium trips, contribute to the use of public transport by providing effective last-mile connectivity and simply take up less space on the road. Also, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems also make an  attractive option for the researchers who can try to understand traffic routes in a city.

You are encouraged to have a look at Bike Rentals companies in general so that you can become more familiar with this business domain.

The data has been collected from [UCI Machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset)


## Exploratory Data Analysis

Now that you have an overview of the business case and a formal problem statement, the very next stage is to explore and understand the data. As you know already, this is also called the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) step. In this section, you will load the data into our analysis environment and explore its properties. It is worth mentioning
again that EDA is one of the most important phases in the whole workflow and can help with not just understanding the dataset, but also in presenting certain fine points that can be useful in the coming steps.


**Note** : The bike sharing dataset contains day level and hour level data sets.


### Preprocessing 

As you have seen in previous project, you always do the basic steps which would include the following :

* Check the shape of datasets and column names (Do it sound appropriate, change if required)

* Look out for missing values.

* Is there any data types conversion required.\

The attribute dteday would require type conversion from object (or string type) to timestamp.
That is, 'dteday' should be a 'datetime' object.\
[pandas datetime] (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html)

Also, attributes like season, holiday, weekday, and so on are inferred as integers by pandas, and they would require conversion to categoricals for proper understanding.

Look out for more changes you would require to do before moving to the data visualisation.



Also consider renaming values to make it look appropriate.


**hdf is hourly data**

```
hdf.loc[hdf['is_holiday'] == 0, 'is_holiday'] = 'No'

hdf.loc[hdf['is_holiday'] == 1, 'is_holiday'] = 'Yes'

```

Or, changing the season values:

```
hdf.loc[hdf['season'] == 1, 'season'] = 'Winter'
hdf.loc[hdf['season'] == 2, 'season'] = 'Spring'
hdf.loc[hdf['season'] == 3, 'season'] = 'Summer'
hdf.loc[hdf['season'] == 4, 'season'] = 'Fall
```

Sometimes it helps to create new features. For example, it would be interesting to have a feature called 'warm days' and you can decide whether it is 'yes' or 'no' based on the temperature of the day.

There are lots of such option. Think what else you think would help you in next steps, however, you can always revisit and create features as you require later.
