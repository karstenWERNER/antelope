Hello Team,

Richard has already gave me a good feedback about the analysis you sent last Friday. I find this feedback very much helpful to boost our confidence and motivate us towards right direction.

In Consulting businesses, we show the clients not only what they require explicitly but also other informative stuffs which might help them to understand their businesses better.

Did you come up with any findings apart from those you already checked that would be worth reporting to Richard.

I assume, there will be days / times / weeks when bike riders will be unusually more/less on the street. Also what do you find about night bikers or is there any pattern of traffic based on location / time of day (Google maps would definitely help in this regard).

Lastly, I would like you to include the KPIs which you find worth measuring alongwith.




Thanks & Regards,\
