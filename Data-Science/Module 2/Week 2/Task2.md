# KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

Knowing the right Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and understanding them are vital to the health and success of
a business.


However, when we onboard new clients, we find that a good proportion of them are uncertain about what they should be measuring and how they can use these powerful tools.  

Effective KPIs are important metrics to ensure that one can accomplish the business objective.

**Can you write down 3 - 5 KPIs which you would like to measure and understand before you present to the CEO.**

*Also, do not forget to explain them in the context of the project.*

Hint:
* Trip duration is a good measure, but it does not take into account how many bikers made the trips. To include them you would rather measure trip duration per trip. 

***Choose your KPI wisely so that it reflects a measure valuable for the business***

* As explanation of your time series forecast (delcine/ increase in customers base), you can have a look at [customer reviews on app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motivateco.capitalbikeshare&hl=en&gl=US&showAllReviews=true)

For a coding bootcamp, how many students get to complete the program once they started/ joined the academy would be good measure of external KPI.

And, what is the attendance rate of a student in class would be an example of internal KPI.

According to optimizesmart.com

' External KPIs are set at the department/team/function level and focus on measuring the overall performance of a department/team. ... Internal KPIs are set at an individual level and focus on measuring the overall performance of an individual'

Think about these before you write an email to Richard.
