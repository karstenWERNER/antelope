# Module 2 : Bike rentals & Ecommerce

## Bike Rentals

Bike rentals give customers,who are very often, but not necessarily, tourists, bicycles for a short period. The Bikes are generally rented for a certain amount of time (ranging from  less than an hour to few hours) to recreationally explore the locality. Also, many city-dwellers prefer to ride bikes instead of cars for many health benefits like cardiovascular fitness,  muscle strength and flexibility, low stress etc. The customers are vaired and consist of different age group, ethnicity and nationality. The global bike rentals are growing at a steady pace.
