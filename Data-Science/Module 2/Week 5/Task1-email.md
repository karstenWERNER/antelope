Hi Team,

Hope you are doing well.

Alan has below questions and I have added my suggestions on top of that:

* What are the top 5 items generating the maximum revenue.

* How is the customer buying pattern.
( I would be interested to know weekly, monthly, daily etc.)

- There might be variouy factors that might play a role. In my last assignment, I used to observe people place a lot of orders in the lunch time. So, this kind of information would add values to our analysis.

* Is there any specific days when the sales have been unusually high / low and what could be the possible reasons ? (This is a very generic question and most of the time you have to make an educated guess with a supporting data.)

* What do you think about the customers ? Are they individuals or wholesalers ?

Can you grab any other information on this.

* Highest number of orders and highest money spent: Can you explore a bit on this.. like which countries / customers.
 
A plot detailing number of orders countrywise and another plot depicting amount of money spent country wise would do the job. 

* Top 5 countries generating the max revenue.
(Can you create a map of them - this is optional and good to have)

- How about excluding the host country ('Germany in this case) to do the same analysis. 

* Quarterly revenue ( How about creating a plotly express animation)

* What are the best-selling and the second best-selling products in every category? (Revenue wise).

(Hint: explore **SQL Window function**)

* New Customer registrations per month for the year 2019.
You can consider MIN("InvoiceDate") as the registration date.

* Can you create a plot showing the growth rate of new customers for the same period (2019).

* What are the other KPIs you can think of.
( Ex- Average revenue per customer for each month in the year 2019)


That's all from Alan's side and I hope, you would be able to respond to Alan with your analysis on or before Thursday.In case, you need some help (regarding the datasets or anything), please reach out to your mentor. 

Thank you for all your hard works!!
