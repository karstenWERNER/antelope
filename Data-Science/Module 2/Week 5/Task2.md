# Final Presentation : E-COMMERCE 

This time also you will be following the previous steps, i.e., You will create a PowerPoint report that will be presented to the management team of 'VS Electronics' and they would like to see how much you have understood the e-commerce business and analysed the data keeping in mind all the KPIs. As there are so many KPIs, I would as usual request you to present only those which you think add the most values.

Alan does not have a proper technical background and you can make it as much business oriented as you can do. However, that means, you should show beautiful plots with a one / two liner explanation. However, you might consider talking about the database set up graphically (without going much into technical details) and do not forget to mention 'why having a centralised database can be a great consideration'. 

(Hint: Talk about how data is stored in the database while customers place a order. On top of that, it would be nice to have some database design concepts you have applied (for example, to reduce redundancy)).


As usual, it is your job to keep Alan and his team engaged and attentive.(Hint : make some questions to the audience and check their response and then reveal your answer to let them know how correct / wrong the audeince predicted - as thumb of rule, select very easy topics or questions for the audience so that audience is correct most of the times and can feel they understand/ follow you.)

The presentation is supposed to include but not limited to below guidelines(these are not in order):


* Product informations in General and the concepts of web scraping and  database.

* Visualizations with sales data Analysis. Minimum of 3 interesting insights which explain the customer behaviour based on time of day/ month of the year / seasons etc.

* A good analysis on KPIs and how the business can harness the power of analytics to improve on those KPIs.

Few of the KPIs which you can mention : (*source:www.cloudways.com*)
