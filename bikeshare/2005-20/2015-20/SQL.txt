RELATIONAL
SQL Structured Query Language
eliminate redundancy (by using a clever db design)
allow to consume huge amounts of data
there is the concept of "tuple" in SQL (like row or record)
Schema: astract structure of tables (int, varchar, .....)
Primary key is needed for all tables (cannot be duplicate or NULL, but it can be 0)
Foreign Key in a table refers to a primary key in another table (can be duplicate) 
DDL Data Dictionary Language => Schema (create table dep (dept_no: varchar(64))), something like that
DQL Data Query Language: select * from dep;

If you're using an operator with values that are non-numeric, you need to put the value in single quotes: 'value'.
The double quotes (as opposed to single: ') are a way of indicating that you are referring to the column name.
Note: SQL uses single quotes to reference column values.

You can use >, <, and the rest of the comparison operators on non-numeric columns as wellâ€”they filter based on alphabetical order.
